I am a Physics Ph.D. student at NYU.
I solve quantum physics problems with computing (and vice versa).
My tools include quantum field theory, optimal control, statistical physics, and machine learning.
My supervisor is Dries Sels.

I completed Part III at the University of Cambridge and Joint Honours Math and Physics at McGill University.
I gained industry experience working in VC and quantitative finance.
My teaching experience includes leading a program that trained prospective physics Olympiad competitors and holding a graduate adjunct position at NYU.
