I am currently a Physics PhD student at NYU. I look at solving quantum physics problems with computing (and vice versa). My tools include quantum field theory, optimal control, statistical physics, and machine learning. My supervisor is Dries Sels. I completed Part III at the University of Cambridge and Joint Honours Math and Physics at McGill University. I gained industry experience working in VC and quantitative finance. I led a program that trained prospective phyics olympiad competitors and held a graduate adjunct position at NYU.
